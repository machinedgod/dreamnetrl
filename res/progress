Start in apartment. Should make sure to get wallet, it has the code to 
the apartment, ID card  and credit encryption key.
If using computer, there's email from Devin.

Get out, go to bar.
Talk to Moe, find out that Devin was here but has left.
There's Johnny and Sally, the newcomers. Delgado is sitting in the corner.

Go to Devin's.
He's in the middle of something, but can spare few minutes. He gives contact
for a small scale job and a contact for base equipment/weaponry.

Go back to apartment, call contacts. Get equipment. Do a first job.
