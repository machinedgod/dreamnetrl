Moe's.
A dive with cheap drinks and interesting clientele. Aside all sorts of shady characters you aren't acqainted with, your buddy Devin frequents here, as its a place to be when looking for some off-the-records merc work.
Moe is the big guy tending the bar. While you'd love to have as much rep as some of the other patrons, you're green and Moe suspiciously measures you head to toe every time you step in.
While this annoys you, you get it. After all, would you believe a hooker (an ex-hooker) saying she wants to start running?
